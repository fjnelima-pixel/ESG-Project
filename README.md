# ESG-Project
## Environmental & Social Risk Screening and ESG Action Plan Tracking for a Bank Loan Portfolio

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how a commercial bank can apply Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) principles to assess, monitor and manage sustainability risks within a loan portfolio.

The analysis simulates Environmental & Social Due Diligence (ESDD), ESG risk scoring, ESAP tracking and green finance opportunity identification, using a multi-country loan portfolio aligned to banking sustainability and compliance workflows.

The project is designed to reflect practical ESG processes used by banks and DFIs, rather than corporate disclosure scoring.

## Business Context
Banks operating across multiple countries face increasing expectations to:
-Integrate environmental and social risk assessments into credit decisions

- Track and close Environmental and Social Action Plans (ESAPs)

- Monitor portfolio-level ESG risk exposure
  
-Identify and scale climate and green finance opportunities

-Support regulatory and DFI sustainability reporting

This project mirrors how ESG and Sustainability teams support these objectives using data analytics and structured reporting.

## Objectives

-Simulate ESG risk screening for loan clients across sectors and geographies

-Identify high environmental and social risk exposures requiring enhanced due diligence

-Track ESAP implementation status across the portfolio

## Dataset

The analysis uses a synthetic loan portfolio dataset, designed to reflect real banking ESRM workflows without exposing confidential data.
Key variables include:
-Client sector and country

-Loan amount

-Environmental and social risk ratings

-HSE compliance status

-ESAP implementation status

-Green finance classification

## Methodology

-ESG Risk Scoring

-Environmental and Social risk ratings converted into numeric scores

-Clients flagged for heightened ESDD based on combined ESG risk

-Portfolio ESG Exposure Analysis

-ESG risk concentration by sector and geography

-Identification of high-risk segments within the loan book

-ESAP Monitoring

-Tracking ESAP status (Not Started, In Progress, Closed)

-Highlighting delays and operational risk areas

-Green Finance Analysis

-Assessment of green-tagged lending

-Identification of potential climate finance growth opportunities


## Reporting Outputs

Clean summary tables suitable for dashboards, management packs or DFI reporting

## Key Insights

-ESG risk exposure is sector-specific  with higher concentrations in energy, construction and agribusiness

-A material share of high-risk clients require active ESAP monitoring

-Green finance penetration remains limited, highlighting opportunities for climate-aligned lending growth

-Structured ESG data improves visibility, accountability and decision-making across sustainability functions

-Analyse green finance penetration and missed sustainability opportunities

-Produce management-ready insights to support decision-making
